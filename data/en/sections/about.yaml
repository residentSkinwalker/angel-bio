# a summary about you
summary: "`Hello World!` I am a self-taught developer seeking an internship / occupation in the `Brisbane` region. I'm currently traversing the perpetual rabbit hole that is `Computer Science` and all its many fields. Always seeking additional knowledge of that which interests me and that which could prove beneficial to your business. I am especially interested in the field of `Cyber Security` with a passion for `pentesting` servers in a home lab environment, CTF challenges, and network analysis using tools like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/). <br> <br> I am presently a student at [TAFE Queensland](https://tafeqld.edu.au) studying for a [Diploma of Information Technology (Advanced Networking and Cloud Engineering)](https://tafeqld.edu.au/course/19/19032/diploma-of-information-technology). In addition to industry certifications, the Cisco [CCNA](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna.html) is next on my horizon."
